### Tips

1. A lot of you probably know that Github has a built-in fuzzy file finder. Press `t` in any repository and start typing the name of the file you want to search for. This is really useful to quickly locate some files.
2. If you're adding lengthy error logs or a verbose program to a comment and it's taking up a lot of vertical space, consider using the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags.

### Cool Extensions to boost your Github Experience

### Octotree

We can do even better to make searching files easier. There's an amazing extension [Octotree](https://github.com/ovity/octotree) which will let you navigate your files in a tree-like structure like you're probably used to on your IDE. It's a really popular extension and is already being used by some many companies including Github themselves.

Not only does it make it easy to get to files, it also helps while you're reviewing pull requests when the file exlporer shows us exactly what files were changed.

### Dark Theme

There are multiple options available if you like using dark theme. There's
[Github Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark "Github Dark") or the easier extension [Github Dark Theme Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-dark-theme/odkdlljoangmamjilkamahebpkgpeacp "Github Dark Theme Extension")

### [Wide guthub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-dark-theme/odkdlljoangmamjilkamahebpkgpeacp "Wide Github")

This is another really simple extension which just makes the repository as wide as it can be on the screen (as seen in the screenshot above) instead of being cetered with white space on the left and right.

### [CodeWyng](https://github.com/CodeWyng/codewyng)

This provides lightning fast code navigation on Github: hover documentation, go-to-definition and find all references of a variable in a file.

### [Github VSCode Icons](https://github.com/dderevjanik/github-vscode-icons)

A neat extension to show vs-code icons for files instead of boring generic icons.
